This project is a scaled down approach to the world of Computer vision that deals in Vehicle Automation.

The main 3 objectives of the project are:
--> To Apply Convolutional neural networks to perform object detection.
--> To Train the application and increase scalability using Transferred Learning technique to make it work in native environment.
--> To Experiment with Fully-Convolutional semantic segmentation networks on a live camera stream.
